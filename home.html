                                <p>Generally speaking, it’s possible to define a keyboard as mechanical if it uses mechanical switches for each key.</p>
                                <p>Firstly, let’s consider the everyday alternative to mechanical switches. Typical, inexpensive, everyday computer keyboards often employ rubber dome switches. As the name implies, these are constructed with a sheet of rubber domes above electrical switches. You press down on a key and the dome collapses causing the key to be switched. You lift up your finger a little and the rubber dome plops back into shape and the key is no longer pressed. Rubber dome switches are popular because they are so cheap compared to manufacture. However, they are certainly not the best way of solving the problem of registering a keypress.</p>
                                <p>Mechanical switches offer a range of tactility unavailable with rubber dome keyboards.</p>
                                <p>Mechanical keyboards are enjoying a renaissance, which although has been going on for a number of years, is really starting to gain more widespread adoption since being embraced by the gaming community.</p>
                                <p>Now, before we get much further into this, I feel it’s my duty to be quite candid. I often read people justifying mechanical keyboards due to the fact that they ‘last longer’. Whilst this is possibly true, I don’t ever remember wearing a keyboard out. And you could probably buy a lifetime of budget keyboards and still have change left compared to the costs of a mechanical keyboard.</p>
                                <p>Buying a mechanical keyboard is not an exercise in sound economics. It’s about finding the best possible version, for you, of a tool you use almost every day. A keyboard that has just the right layout, feel, and aesthetics. Once you have your keyboard, I like to think you will rise every morning chanting the mechanical keyboard owners.</p>

                                <h2>Linear</h2>
                                <p>Linear switches offer a smooth keystroke all the way down. These switches are a popular choice for gamers who gravitate to these options to take advantage of their lightness and short pre-travel distance. Leaning into faster switch options can help you register keystrokes as quickly as possible, which can make a difference in competitive gaming scenarios.</p>
                                <h2>Tactile</h2>
                                <p>The middle option between linear and clicky, a tactile switch, has a tactile 'bump' you overcome when pressing a key. Many typists prefer tactile switches because the tactile bump provides the physical confirmation that you've registered a key, helping you minimize typos. Also, tactile switches generally aren't loud enough to be a disruption to those around you, even in open office environments.</p>
                                <h2>Clicky</h2>
                                <p>True to their name, these switches make clicky sounds. These switches have a well-earned reputation for being loud and often somewhat heavier-feeling than other switches. Some are quieter than others, but generally speaking, they can be disruptive for other people around you, and some workplaces even have policies against using them in open office settings.</p>
